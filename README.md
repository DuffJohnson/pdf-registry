# pdf-registry
Registry of Second Class extensions to PDF

## Instructions
On behalf of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and in support of ISO 32000, Adobe maintains this registry.  It is freely open to all PDF developers following the specifications given in Annex E of ISO 32000. 
To avoid conflicts with other prefixes, PDF names and extensions, create a new Issue, filling out the template to register the ones you want to reserve. Assuming that the name has not been used already, it will be added to the XLSX file.

## Additional Details
The XLSX file in this repository contains all developer prefixes that have been registered since 2008 (when ISO 32000-1 was published).  However, due to legal reasons, Adobe maintains the list of all registrations that occured prior to that date.
