# PDF Registry
On behalf of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and in support of ISO 32000, Adobe maintains this registry of developer prefixes for PDF.  It is freely open to all PDF developers following the specifications given in Annex E of ISO 32000. 

## Instructions
Create a new Issue, filling out the template to register the prefix you want to reserve. Assuming that the name has not been used already, it will be added to the XLSX file and you will receive an email confirmation.  If there is a conflict, you will be notified and can select and alternative.

## Additional Details
The XLSX file in this repository contains all developer prefixes that have been registered since 2008 (when ISO 32000-1 was published).  However, due to legal reasons, Adobe maintains the list of all registrations that occured prior to that date.
